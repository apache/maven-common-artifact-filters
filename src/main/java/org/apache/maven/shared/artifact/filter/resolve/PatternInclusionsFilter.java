/**
 * A simple filter to include artifacts from a list of patterns. The artifact pattern syntax is of the form:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * [groupId]:[artifactId]:[extension]:[version]
 * [groupId]:[artifactId]:[extension]:[classifier]:[version]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Where each pattern segment is optional and supports full and partial <code>*</code> wildcards. An empty pattern
 * segment is treated as an implicit wildcard. Version can be a range in case a {@code VersionScheme} is specified.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, <code>org.apache.*</code> would match all artifacts whose group id started with
 * <code>org.apache.</code> , and <code>:::*-SNAPSHOT</code> would match all snapshot artifacts.
